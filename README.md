## AVL-tree
AVL-tree is a self-balancing binary search tree.
It achieves all of the search, insert and delete with O(logn) time complexity even in the worst case.

This project includes search, insert and delete along with other utility functions like print and reset. 

## Usage
I have made a make file for compiling. You can compile in command line:
~~~
$ make
$ ./a < sample.in 
~~~
To test the results.
